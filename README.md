# WeCraft üöÄ

**WeCraft** is a public build-in-public platform connecting technical founders and developers, built with Phoenix LiveView and implementing a context-driven architecture with clean separation of concerns.

## Overview

WeCraft enables technical founders to showcase their projects and connect with skilled developers who want to contribute to exciting ventures. Whether you're building the next big SaaS, exploring fintech solutions, or working on cutting-edge healthtech innovations, WeCraft helps you find the right collaborators.

### Key Features

- **Project Showcase**: Technical founders can create detailed project profiles with descriptions, tech stacks, and current status
- **Developer Matching**: Smart search and filtering to match developers with projects based on technical skills and business domains  
- **Real-time Chat**: Built-in messaging system for project discussions and collaboration
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Passwordless login system for seamless user experience
- **Tag-based Discovery**: Comprehensive tagging system for technologies (Elixir, Phoenix, React, etc.) and business domains (Fintech, Healthtech, SaaS, etc.)
- **Project Status Tracking**: Track projects from idea stage through development to live deployment

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- **Phoenix Contexts**: Clean separation with `Accounts`, `Projects`, `Profiles`, and `Chats` contexts
- **Use Case Pattern**: Business logic delegated to `WeCraft.*.UseCases.*UseCase` modules
- **Domain Models**: Schema validation and business logic in `lib/we_craft/*/`
- **LiveView Frontend**: Interactive web layer in `lib/we_craft_web/` with real-time updates

### Authentication System

- **Magic Link Based**: No passwords required - uses email token-based authentication
- **Scoped Authentication**: User sessions with `WeCraft.Accounts.Scope.for_user/1`
- **User Roles**: Technical Founder or Developer personas
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based sessions with remember-me functionality

### Database Design

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with array fields for flexible tag storage
- **Project Status Enum**: `[:idea, :in_dev, :private_beta, :public_beta, :live]`
- **Tag Validation**: Predefined technical and business tag lists with validation
- **Real-time Features**: Chat messaging with Phoenix PubSub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.15+
- Erlang/OTP 26+
- Node.js (for assets)
- PostgreSQL

```

### Tag System

WeCraft uses a comprehensive tagging system for project discovery:

**Technical Tags**: `elixir`, `phoenix`, `react`, `javascript`, `python`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, etc.
**Business Domains**: `fintech`, `healthtech`, `saas`, `ecommerce`, `productivity`, `analytics`, etc.

Tags are validated against predefined lists and automatically normalized to lowercase.

### LiveView Architecture

All major features use Phoenix LiveView with proper mount hooks:

```elixir
live_session :require_authenticated_user,
  on_mount: [{WeCraftWeb.UserAuth, :require_authenticated}]
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests with fresh test database
make test

# Generate LCOV coverage report  
make coverage

# Run specific test files
mix test test/we_craft/projects/
```

### Test Fixtures

Tests use fixtures from `test/support/fixtures/*_fixtures.ex`:

- `AccountsFixtures.user_fixture/1` for authenticated users
- `ProjectsFixtures.project_fixture/1` for test projects
- `AccountsFixtures.user_scope_fixture/1` for scoped contexts

## Production Deployment

### Docker Support

The project includes multi-stage Docker builds:

```bash
# Build and push Docker image
make build-and-push-docker-image

# Deploy to production
make deploy-to-prod
```
